Neonatal monitoring is critical for ensuring the health and well-being of infants in the early stages of life. 
Existing monitoring devices are often invasive, uncomfortable, and can limit the mobility of the infant. 
In this project, we tried to design and develop a smart band for neonatal monitoring that addresses the above limitations. 
Our smart band measures the heart rate, and body temperature using non-invasive sensors. 
The smart band has the potential to revolutionize neonatal monitoring, as it is very comfortable for neonates to wear and also provides continuous monitoring, 
which is alternative to traditional monitoring devices. 
This project mainly concentrates on designing a smart band for neonates for monitoring their vital signs such as Body temperature and heart rate.
